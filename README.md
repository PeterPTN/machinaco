## Task Checklist

### MVP and Additional Details
- The main.scss file includes styling for the footer and nav shared across all pages
- The import.scss file includes mixins and variables shared across all pages
- Each html page has it's own scss/css file for organisation purposes
- Media queries are implemented within their dedicated scss/css file
- Display flex was primarily used to stack elements vertically
- Display grid was used to create/adapt different column layouts
- BEM was used to describe containers, SASS was used for easy nesting

### Pages
- The index/landing page includes a hero with a call to action along with a section briefly describing their services. 
- The about page explains their founding year and type of services in greater detail
- The technology page includes a variety of lists which outline the programming languages and frameworks used for their services
- The projects page includes a 3 column layout of 6 different projects (desktop view). Each project has a brief description of what it is and what language was primarily used to create it.
- The contacts page includes a simple form, email and phone details along with personnel information

### Additional Information
The overall styling of the website is a mish-mash of different software development company websites I saw. 
I used a simple color palette of different shades of black and white while incorporating (mainly) reds and blues to signifiers and to add overall contrast.
I kept consistency across all pages by maintaining similar spacing across all pages and re-using assets in the form of mixins (most notable on button and borders).
